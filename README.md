# Word-Guess-Game
Airlock- Science Fiction Edition
 
This is a word guessing game.  Guess the word one letter at a time. First category is Science Fiction Villains.  If dash appears in word that equals a space and must be pressed to count as a win. If you lose, the Captain will be sucked out of the air lock.  

Good Luck!
